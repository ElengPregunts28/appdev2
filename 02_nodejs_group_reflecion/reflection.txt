In our project, I was assigned as a Project Manager. My role is to lead my team
to achieve the project's goal. The success of a project heavily depends on us, 
as we are the one who are responsible for initiating the planning process, clearly
defining the project's scope, goals, and objectives. We are trained to develop
detailed plans outlining tasks, timelines, and deliverables. We are the one
who assemble and direct project teams, assigning tasks based on members' skills
and experience. We focus and unify team efforts by promoting collaboration, 
resolving conflicts, and leading effective team meetings. 

At first I was very hesitant to take this role as I'm not confident enough with 
my leadership or communication skills. But my members convinced me that they need
me to be a Project Manager so our team could be balance. I took the role and with
the help of my Co-Project Manager Justine, I think we lead the team well. We 
conduct daily meetings to track the progress of each tasks, discuss ideas, and 
address issues to solve. Working my team provided me an experience that will help 
me prepare as I enter the work industry. The skills and expertise of each members 
help us in achieving the project goals. Although my team has still a big room for 
improvement on their skills and timelines, I can see that they are 
continuously improving on their different chosen areas. 

As a Project Manager, I still need to boost my confidence level and enhance my 
leadership skills, communication skills, as well as my documentation skills. I 
also aspire to be competent and strict with deadlines.
